NOTE: An issue can arise if two rooms are the same size where the order of which room comes first in the dictionary will change the result of the function, example: a bedroom of dimensions (10,10) and a bathroom with dimensions (10,10), depending on which comes first in the dictionary will yield a different result, needs to be fixed if used in a larger scale
